=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.22.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.22.1
release and the cperl 5.22.2 release.

For B<cperl> see F<Changes> and L<perlcperl>

=head1 Core Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Creating *{"_<$filename"} Perl debugger data structures (see
L<perldebguts/"Debugger Internals">) for XSUBs and const subs has been
removed.  This removed one glob/scalar combo for each unique C<.c>
file that XSUBs and const subs came from.  On startup (C<perl -e"0">)
about half a dozen glob/scalar debugger combos were created.  Loading
XS modules created more glob/scalar combos.  These things were created
regardless if the perl debugger was being used or not, unlike for pure
perl subs, and ignores that the perl debugger can not debug C code.

=item *

Re-added the C<PL_sv_objcount> interpreter-global variable used to track the total
number of Perl objects in the interpreter, which was removed in Perl 5.20.
It is beneficial for all scripts which do not create objects in global scope,
so we dont have to check all remaining SV's to call a potential DESTROY method.

This broke binary back-compatibility on MULTIPLICITY and ITHREAD builds with 5.22.1.

=item *

Minor improvements in the lexer code (F<toke.c>). Added helper
functions, LEX_TYPE_*BRACKETS_ON|OFF macros, better DEBUGGING support.
regen_perly keeps now useful temp. files.

=item *

Add support for additional F<pod/perlcdelta.pod> in F<Porting/pod_rules.pl>.

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item Config 5.022002

Config is now a regular XS module, which could theoretically even be
uploaded to CPAN. This improves platform support and parallel build
fragility.
The Config tables are now also readonly.

=item threads 2.02_01

Protect C<ithread_free> from deleted C<PL_modglobal> during global destruction.

=item ExtUtils-Embed 1.34c

Optimize C<boot_DynaLoader>, fix a couple of stack errors.

=item Test::Harness

Fix 2 tests broken with readonly Config.

=item Time::HiRes 1.9727_02

To improve parallel builds on Windows.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item *

Improved support for threaded builds.

=item *

Windows support was added. There is also new support for parallel builds.

=item *

Better DynaLoader support for os2, symbian, Netware.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the C<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug please file an issue at
L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
