=item B-C 1.54_05

Fix refcount of cop hints hashes with 5.22-nt (#220)
Better UVX L and U suffices
Handle shared IV and UV xpv structs.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item Fix C<for my$var> regression

Fixed cperl-5.22.2 regression causing the error
"Missing $ on loop variable". Also with C<for our$> (#145)

=item Fix FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES callbacks

Both arguments to FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES callbacks were wrong. The first was
an unassignable stash and is now the package name, and the 2nd was a cv and
is now a cvref. This was broken in cperl5.22.1 and cperl5.22.2 (#147)

=item Wrong "Can't find Unicode property definition" error

The "Can't find Unicode property definition" error was called even
with C<!SvPOK retval>, caused by misleading indentation in utf8.c

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history including the perl and cperl repos. In particular,
it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker and the cperl github issues.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish. Their quality of work succeeds
the work of the perl5 porters by far.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the C<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to C<perlbug@perl.org> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to C<perl5-security-report@perl.org>.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the p5p core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.

If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to
them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are
unwilling to fix them.
