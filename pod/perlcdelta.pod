=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.25.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.25.2
and the cperl 5.25.3 development releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.25.1c, first read
L<perl5252cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.25.1c and v5.25.2c

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms
that support it

Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in
UTF-8 locales.  Perl now works with those.  For portability and full
control, L<Unicode::Collate> is still recommended, but now you may
not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on
your application.  See
L<perllocale/Category C<LC_COLLATE>: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting>

=head2 Better locale collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL>
characters

In locales that have multi-level character weights, these are now
ignored at the higher priority ones.  There are still some gotchas in
some strings, though.  See
L<perllocale/Collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL> characters>.

=head2 Unescaped literal C<"{"> characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C<"\{"> or C<"[{]"> to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET.  This will allow future extensions to the
language.  This restriction is not enforced, nor are there current plans
to enforce it, if the C<"{"> is the first character in the pattern.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
displayed starting in v5.22.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
v5.20.  This affects things like C<$I<\cT>>, where I<\cT> is a literal
control (such as a C<NAK> or C<NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE> character) in the
source code.

=head2 C<qr//xx> is no longer permissible

Using more than one C</x> regular expression pattern modifier on a
single pattern is now forbidden.  This is to allow a future enhancement
to the language.  This usage has been deprecated since v5.22.

=head2 C<NBSP> is no longer permissible in C<\N{...}>

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl v5.22.

=head2 C<CORE> subroutines for hash and array functions callable via
reference

The hash and array functions in the C<CORE> namespace--C<keys>, C<each>,
C<values>, C<push>, C<pop>, C<shift>, C<unshift> and C<splice>--, can now
be called with ampersand syntax (C<&CORE::keys(\%hash>) and via reference
(C<< my $k = \&CORE::keys; $k->(\%hash) >>).  Previously they could only be
used when inlined.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine

C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine can no longer be assigned
to in list context.

    sub foo : lvalue { keys(%INC) }
    (foo) = 3; # death
    sub bar : lvalue { keys(@_) }
    (bar) = 3; # also an error

This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with C<(keys %hash) = ...> and
C<(keys @_) = ...>, which are also errors.  [perl #128187]

=head1 Deprecations

=over

=item *

The new v5.24 Config keys B<d_newlocale>, B<d_freelocale> and
B<d_uselocale> and corresponding F<config.h> defines B<HAS_NEWLOCALE>,
B<HAS_FREELOCALE> and B<HAS_USELOCALE> are unused and deprecated with
v5.25.3c

The new v5.26 upstream Config keys B<i_xlocale> and B<d_duplocale> are
never stored as such, and are not available in cperl.

=back

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding. They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that C<use strict "subs">
would still apply to bareword constants. That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.

This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=head2 F<Porting/bench.pl>

=over 4

=item *

allow per-PUT (perl under test) options and modules

Rework process_perls() to give a richer usage / API, allowing
additional command-line options, specific to each Perl-Under-Test.
For example:

    Porting/bench.pl -- perl=plain perl=slower -Mstrict -DmpMA

The above runs the same perl-exe for 2 different tests (PUTS), but
adds expensive debugging options to only the 2nd PUT.

=item *

provide per-PUT environment

    $ perl Porting/bench.pl --jobs=2 \
       --verbose --debug --tests=/loop::for::pkg_/ \
       -- \
       cperl5.25.3:+bare \
       cperl5.25.3=+full:PERL_MEM_LOG=3mst,PERLIO=:stdio -MData::Dumper

this will run:

    PERL_HASH_SEED=0 PERLIO=:stdio PERL_MEM_LOG=3mst valgrind \
      --tool=cachegrind --branch-sim=yes --cachegrind-out-file=/dev/null \
      cperl5.25.3  -MData::Dumper - 20 2>&1

Note that ':' is now a valid separator between the perl & label, but
not between ENVAR=value pairs, where a ',' is required.

=item *

store data using unique label, not perl-exe, which may be used 2x

=item *

add B<=+label> feature, which appends the label to perl-name

Using this reduces the burden of keeping each label unique,
simplifying the use of labels to name varying workloads created by
C<<< -Mfoo -M<something-heavy> >>>

This enables an invocation like the following to run -DDEBUGGING
perls-A,B in bare mode, and heavily encumbered by -Dflag induced
overhead:

     $] perl Porting/bench.pl --jobs=2 \
        --tests=/loop::for::my/ \
        -- \
        perl-A=+bare perl-A=+workload -DpsltocPmfr \

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
